# Hello there!

My name is `Eduardo Henke`, I'm from Brazil(from this [pretty island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis)). I was a **co-founder** at [Voltbras](https://voltbras.com.br/), I worked at [Higher Order Company](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO).

I've finished my B.Sc. in **Computer Science** at [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/), and I'm now doing a **M.Sc** in Computer Science at [Federal University of Ouro Preto](https://ufop.br/), advancing my studies in formal methods and interaction combinators.

## My principle

My principle([as someone explained the term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII)) is to:

> Simplify development through the improvement of programming languages

To achieve that, I believe that we need to focus on:
- easier ways to verify **correctness**
- easier ways to **model** a problem
- **faster** software

I strongly believe that **type systems**(and other kinds of static analysis) are **the** way to achieve that.


## Research interests

I'm interested in researching about:
- `computational models`
  - `interaction combinators`
  - `interaction nets`
- `type theory`
  - `dependent types`
  - `cubical types`
  - `gradual typing`
- `category theory`
- `high-level optimization`(e.g. [grin](https://grin-compiler.github.io/))
- `program synthesis`

## Projects

- [**TaPL impl**](https://github.com/eduhenke/tapl-impl): implementations of the type systems' from [TaPL](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/), in `Haskell`
- [**dep-tt**](https://github.com/eduhenke/dep-tt): a dependent type system, in `Haskell`
- [**ts-ocpp**](https://github.com/voltbras/ts-ocpp): fully-typed and functionally written implementation of OCPP(Open Charge Point Protocol, i.e. protocol to communicate with Electric Vehicle chargers), in `Typescript`
- [**simple lang**](https://github.com/eduhenke/ferrugem-lang): a simple compiler for a simple language, in `Rust`
