# Hello there!

My name is `Eduardo Henke`, I'm from Brazil(from this [pretty island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis)) and I'm currently a **co-founder/partner/backend-engineer** at [Voltbras](https://voltbras.com.br/).

I'm finishing my B.Sc. in **Computer Science** at [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/), and I'm currently applying to **PhD** programmes in Computer Science, regarding my research interests.

## My principle

My principle([as someone explained the term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII)) is to:

> Simplify development through the improvement of programming languages

To achieve that, I believe that we need to focus on:
- easier ways to verify **correctness**
- easier ways to **model** a problem
- **faster** software

I strongly believe that **type systems**(and other kinds of static analysis) are **the** way to achieve that.


## Research interests

Primary research interests(with some degree of knowledge and actively learning):
- `type theory`
- `dependent types`
- `cubical types`
- `homotopy type theory`
- `category theory`
- `gradual typing`

Secondary research interests(basic knowledge):
- `high-level optimization`(e.g. [grin](https://grin-compiler.github.io/))
- `program synthesis`
- `design by contract`
- `constraint-based programming`
- `aspect-oriented programming`
- `feature-oriented programming`


## Projects

- [**TaPL impl**](https://github.com/eduhenke/tapl-impl): implementations of the type systems' from [TaPL](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/), in `Haskell`
- [**dep-tt**](https://github.com/eduhenke/dep-tt): a dependent type system, in `Haskell`
- [**ts-ocpp**](https://github.com/voltbras/ts-ocpp): fully-typed and functionally written implementation of OCPP(Open Charge Point Protocol, i.e. protocol to communicate with Electric Vehicle chargers), in `Typescript`
- [**simple lang**](https://github.com/eduhenke/ferrugem-lang): a simple compiler for a simple language, in `Rust`
