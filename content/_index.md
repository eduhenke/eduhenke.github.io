# Hello there!

My name is `Eduardo Henke` and I'm currently a co-founder/partner/backend-engineer at [Voltbras](https://voltbras.com.br/).

I'm also an undergrad CS student at [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/).
My research interests reside in the following topics:

- Programming Language
  - Type Theory/Dependent-typing
  - High level optimization(like [grin](https://grin-compiler.github.io/))
  - Don't know if there's a formal topic about this one, but, I want to decrease the gap between our thoughts and the medium in which we write them(programming language), i.e. find out if there's a way to have the "most declarative" programming language.
- Automated Reasoning
  - Automated Theorem Provers
  - Automated Proof Checkers
